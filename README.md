### What's Crucible?

Crucible, a fork of [Thermos](https://github.com/CyberdyneCC/Thermos),
is a CraftBukkit and Forge server implementation for 1.7.10,
providing the ability to load both Forge mods and Bukkit plugins alongside each other.

We aim to close the gaps left by Thermos and extend the support for those still using 1.7.10 by adding support for long
broken mods and plugins and fix serious bugs as they appear.

Advantages over Thermos:
+ Working/stable build across systems
+ Several bugfixes
+ Performance improvements
+ Updated libraries for newer plugin support
* Implemented TimingsV2
* Java 8â€“21 supported (using an integrated version of [lwjgl3ify](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/lwjgl3ify))
+ Backported Bukkit APIs (With some APIs requiring the companion mod [NecroTempus](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/NecroTempus))
+ You can see more changes in the [releases](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Crucible/releases) changelog.
